                  STEP 1: CREATE A PROJECT ON INTELLIJ
                  Open your intellij
                  Click on File>New>Project
                  Click Next > Next
                  Project Name : my_github_project
                  ----------------------
                  STEP 2: CREATE GITHUB REPOSITORY
                  Repository(git repo) means github project folders. We must create a repository to store projects.
                  Repository means folder in the github and its mandatory
                  We already installed git.
                  ***** Steps for creating a repository
                   https://github.com/ and login
                  *** click on your profile
                  *** click on "Your repositories"
                  *** click on "New"
                  *** repository name : my-first-git-repo
                  *** select public or private then click on "Create repository.."
                  ---------------------
                  STEP 3: PUSH THE FIRST CODE TO GITHUB
                  *Open intellij terminal
                  *Then follow the instruction on github!!!!
                          1- git init
                           Done only once for each project. This is used for initializing the project. This will create .git folder to store the project versions!!!
                           When we push for the first time we must use "git init"

                  NOTE: If you see :  The term 'git' is not recognized
                  It means github installation is not complete
                  Then get in touch with teach support

                           2- git add .
                            : Done after each code change.
                            : Adds the code in the staging area
                            : git add . means this will move the code from our computer to staging area

                          3- git commit -m "my first commit"
                           : Done after each code change
                           : This is used for creating new version of the project
                           : m means message to give a message you can give any message you want, commit means version

                                *git branch -M main
                               : Done once for each project

                          4- git remote add origin https://github.com/abayramus/my-first-git-repo.git
                             This step is unique for all of you
                             Done once for each project

                          -> git remove remote origin

                          5- git push -u origin main
                          :Done once for each project

                 ***If your code is successfully pushed, then you should refresh your github and see your code in github
                 ***If you see error read the error message I'm repeating the steps all over again

                 DONE*****

                 *********Git Push Practice*********
                 After the first push, we do not use some of the git commends that we used in the first commit.

                 1. Create a new java class under src : FirstJavaClass
                 2. Create a main method and write some code:
                 public class FirstJavaClass {
                     public static void main(String[] args) {
                         System.out.println("Learning github");
                     }
                 }

                 3. Then push this code to the same repository

                     *git add .
                     *git commit -m "second commit"
                     *git push


                  ***********************************************

                 HOW TO PULL THE CODE FROM GITHUB TO LOCAL COMPUTER
                 *Create a new file : test_file.txt
                 *Add some comments :
                 Do not delete this file.
                 This file is Ms. Filiz's code
                 *Commit new file
                 ***Now we created a file in github

                 We will get that code from github to intelliJ.
                 In intelliJ terminal write below commend to pull the code
                     *git pull

                 ***USEFULL COMMENDS:

                 git status :
                 This is our friend
                 It means we see the status of our codes
                 We can use this anytime to see where you are




       What is Git?
       Git is a version control tool
       Git => Local Repository (local means computer)

       Version means different new update
       Version means the commit => Version = Commit
       Commit means version, Whenever we add new version it means we are adding a new commit. They are the same thing
       Version Control means we use Git to create some project version in our computer as well as in the github.com

       Git and GitHub are different things
       GitHub means the remote repository
       GitHub => Remote Repository (github.com)
