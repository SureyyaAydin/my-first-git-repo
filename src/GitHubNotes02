    How to send one specific class to the github?
    - git add "file name"

    - If you work together, In that case you do "git pull" frequently everyday to make sure my code is up to date

                     Day02

     Create a new class RemoteJavaClass.java under src folder
     - Create new file
     - Type below code in that file
     public class RemoteJavaClass {
         //This will also have some java code
     }
    - Scroll down and click "Commit new file"
    - git pull
    Then your github code should be in your local repo
    When you refresh (you can refresh your intellij > Reload from Disk) you should see RemoteJavaClass in your local machine


    How to push ONLY ONE SPECIFIC file?
    - git add "path of the file"  For example: git add " (src/ForthJavaClass.java)" =>  This means add only that file. This code should push only src/ForthJavaClass
    - git commit -m "message" => give any commit message you want
    - git push

    *** If you did auto add, it is automatically add. If you want to cancel;
    Click on Search > Confirmation > Do not add > OK  => It will not automatically add the files

    *** If you see this kind of error message ( error: failed to push some refs to..), you follow this step
      SOLUTION:
    - git pull
    - git add .
    - git commit -m "message"
    - git push

    *** If you get an error again and again, do that => git reset --hard origin/main
        reset means it is delete the code, If the codes are not in the github


    How to ignore a file?
    You have hundred file, you want to push 99 of them, you do not want to push one of them => INTERVIEW
    What do you do?
    We have away to ignore specific files
    We use ".gitignore" to ignore specific files
    Create file
    Right Click on Project > New > File => The file name must be ".gitignore"
                                           => .gitignore file will have files that you do not want to send
                                           => We add the path of classes that we want to ignore
                                           => For example, if you add EightJavaClass.java in .gitignore then that file cannot be pushed to github
                                           => It will be not trackable
                                           => How can we make it visible?
                                           => Remove the path of the class from the .gitignore
                                           => Can I ignore more than one file? Yes, I can

    How to get the code from github?
    - git pull => brings and adds to your local repo
     When you try to pull code - git fetch
                               - git merge
                               - git pull; you do not have to this two (git fetch + git merge) one by one, You can just do "git pull"
     'git pull' is enough to get the code from github to local repository ( git pull = git fetch + git merge)


     If you pull, but at the same time developer change the code in github. It is not a conflict. You have to the 'git pull' one more time.
     Whenever there is a change in github, You have to the git pull so you have to update your local code.

     VERY IMPORTANT PART;
     When you try to push the code, you get some error; 'failed to push some refs' Because github is protecting our code.
     github.com is the boss, If your local intellij is not updated, you can not send the code
     Solution; We have to pull before we push
     Every single time, When we try to send some code, We have to try to get the latest one
     To make sure our intellij is up to date then send the code,
     Follow this steps; github.com > Add file > Create new file > The file name will be; 'MyNotes2.txt' > Commit new file
                        Intellij > In the project level right click > New > File > The file name will be; 'MyNotes3.txt'
                        MyNotes2.txt => Is it in my Intellij? => not yet
                        MyNotes3.txt => It is not in github
                        Do I have the latest updated github code in my intellij? => No
                        Whatever in github must be in our local so we can send the code Otherwise If github let us push it then this will be delete it
                        We have to pull the code, before push
                        Without getting this file (MyNotes2.txt) in my local, Can I push this code (MyNotes3.txt)? No!
                        For that reason, we get the error because my intellij is not updated
                        Solution; *** 'git pull' before 'git push' ***
                                      - git pull
                                      - git add.
                                      - git commit -m "message"
                                      - git push
                        I do not get error,  My local is updated. I fix that.
                        There is a synchronization going on between github and our local


     CONFLICT
     Conflict means disagreement
     Conflict means there is a problem
     If local(intellij) and remote(github) has different code on the same line then we get conflict when we try to merge the code
     Conflict happens when github and local has different code on the same line
     github will ask you 'what do you want to do?'
     Sometimes it does not even ask base on the configuration it may not even ask, it will merge
     In that case, we have to fix it manually or some settings can fix it automatically
     Automatic merge is not good, because you have to read the code understand 'what is going on?'
     If they are in different line, It is not a conflict, permission / order issue
     I have to pull the code before push, When I pull, I will not get any issue.
     But, If they are in the same line different codes, car crash!

     HOW DO YOU RESOLVE CONFLICT?
     If github and Intellij has DIFFERENT CODES in the SAME LINE
     We will fix it manually;
     - After the git pull, When we see Conflict message, It means it is not good
       In that case, We can manually illegal characters(error messages) remove to intellij
       Then  - git add.
             - git commit -m "message"
             - git push

     *** Always keep your local repository updated; - git pull before push


     What is Branch?
     Branch means new path that we should use to create our code
     We should not use main branch as a scratch work
     Master/ main branch should never have an issue, master branch should be very stable, We should not make any mistake in the master branch
     We do not work on master branch, We should create new branches
     I can create own branches that will be copy of master
     Each person in the team works in their own local branch and push their own remote repo

     Branch Commands
     - git branch -a ; a means all, shows all branches

     How do I create my own branch?
     - git branch sureyya
     - git branch ; I check if my branch is created
     * main => stars means this is which branch I'm on

     How can I switch to sureyya branch?
     - git checkout sureyya ; checkout means switch to sureyya branch
     - git branch

      How can I switch back to main branch?
      - git checkout main

     Our branch code will not be in master branch;
     1) Switch to sureyya branch, If you are in main - git branch
                                                     - git checkout sureyya
     2) I create a class(MyLocalClass1) under the src, commit it that class  - git add.
                                                                             - git commit -m "sureyya branch codes"
                                                                               MyLocalClass1 will not be main, It is in sureyya branch
     I did my branch to create a copy of master When we do some commit It will not be automatically commit in master branch
     For protective, for security reason

     When it is first push;  - git push --set-upstream origin sureyya


     Compare & pull request
     To merge the code from local to master, Usually normal people does not know this merge
     Usually their lead that kind of people knows how to merge it, but If you work in your on local code you also need to know it
     But in company's not everyone does it
     'pull request' means the experience lead will merge to the master that person is responsible from master branch
     If master branch has issue, that person will be responsible
     I'm not responsible, I pushed my code, that's it
     That person will check it and push the code to master branch
     That person has last experience, knows everything, very careful
     Click on Compare & pull request > Write > Create pull request > Merge pull request (We are merging the code in master) > Confirm merge
